Sometimes, the struggle that a creative mind faces is the inability to project or materialize the vision that is inside their heads. The creative minds that we are referring to in this case specifically are people that can visualize images that are as clear as day. 

The problem comes when they are given tools to project those images on to a physical platform. Those tools might be as novel as a canvas and a paintbrush or as modern as a photoshop software. What we set out to do is remove the barrier between the conception of the image and the actualization of the image on to the physical realm. This will be done by removing the intermediate layer of the process.

Neural Visualizer (NeuV.Ai) will use the ability of Deep Learning to synthesize realistic images based on semantic restrictions. Users will be able to define desired images using features or objects and semantic maps. Additionally, users will be able to specify features of the image such as the time of the day and the atmosphere.
